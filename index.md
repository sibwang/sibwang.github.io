## About Me

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Information Science at Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU), supervised by [Prof. Shusen Yang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/shusenyang)). I am also currently working as a research assistant in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Hong Xu](https://henryhxu.github.io). Before this, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University. I was a visiting student at Michigan State University (MSU) in 2018.

## Research Interests

- **Network Optimization for Real-Time Communication
:** With the increasing popularity of low-latency interactive networked applications such as video conferencing, cloud gaming, remote operation, etc., it is crucial to rethink and redesign the control and scheduling algorithms in many aspects of current networked systems.
- **AI-Assisted Network Optimization:** AI (or machine learning) is a powerful technique that has shown success in various domains. Harnessing AI-based methods for optimizing networked systems and applications holds promise but poses significant challenges in practice, particularly in real networks.
